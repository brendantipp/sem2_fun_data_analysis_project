# Semester 2 Fundamentals of Data Analysis


## GMIT Project for Fundamentals of Data Analysis Semester2

Tasks
1. Create single Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on a  data set "powerproduction"
2. withing notebook include explantion of the regression and an anaylsis of its accuracy
3. Compare simple linear regression to other types of regression on the data set

Expectation of the python analysis file

- To Perform simple linear regression on the data set including analysis of its accuracy. Make predictions from a Train/Test Dataset


#### How to run or view the Jupyter Notebook


The Jupyter notebook can be viewed on my My repository is held on GitHub - https://github.com/brendantipp/sem2_fun_data_analysis_project

You can also download and run the Jupyter notebook from the repository to your local hard drive and open with Jupyter Notebooks - www.jupyter.org

The following is useful step by step guide on how to open and run a jupyter notebook - https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html
